HTML:
Firstly, you need to create an HTML document and include a form element that will contain all the input fields 
for the student enrollment form. Inside the form element, you can add different input fields like text fields, 
select boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. based on the required details for the student enrollment.
Each input field should have a label element that describes the input field. Additionally,
you can add a submit button at the bottom of the form to submit the form data.

CSS:
Next, you can style the form and its elements using CSS. You can add styles for the form element, input fields,
and buttons to make it visually appealing and easy to use. Additionally, you can add responsive design properties
to make the form look good on different devices like desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

JavaScript:
Finally, you can add JavaScript code to validate the form inputs and submit the form data to the server. You can use event listeners to
detect when the form is submitted and write functions to validate each input field based on the required format. You can also use regular 
expressions to validate the format of input fields like email and phone number. Once the form is validated, you can submit the form data using 
AJAX or fetch APIs to the server and display a success message to the user.

Overall, creating a student enrollment form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves designing the form, styling it,
validating the inputs, and submitting the form data to the server.
